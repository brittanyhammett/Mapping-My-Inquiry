# 📘 Mapping My Inquiry

**A visual exploration of past, current, and future research projects.**

This project presents a personal academic journey through a **donut chart visualization** and categorized topic list, built using Python and Matplotlib. It showcases research areas from undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral-level studies with a systems-based lens on sustainability, resilience, and human security.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- **Donut Chart Visualization**  
  A graphical representation of research categories: Past, Current, Planned, Interests, Presentations, and Conferences.

- **Detailed Topic Breakdown**  
  Each category includes specific project titles, type of work (e.g., paper, presentation), context, and date.

- **Jupyter Notebook**  
  Code for generating the visualization, with structured loading from a JSON data file.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This project is part of a larger doctoral exploration of sustainability and socio-ecological resilience. It demonstrates:

- **Mixed-method research organization**
- **Data visualization in academic planning**
- **Transparent, reflective scholarly mapping**

Whether you're a fellow researcher, potential collaborator, or just curious about the intersection of resilience, disaster science, and sustainability, this repo offers a clear window into my research path.
